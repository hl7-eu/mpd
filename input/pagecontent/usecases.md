The implementation guide explicitly covers the following use cases:
- Issuing a prescription for a medicinal product to a patient,
- Cancelling or updating a prescription,
- Dispensing a medicinal product to a patient or their proxy according to an existing prescription,
- Refusing to dispense and recording the reason for declined dispense.

The implementation guide aims to stay flexible for additional use cases and not add restrictions unless they are applicable for all related use cases as well.
