The scope of this implementation guide is **Medication Prescription and Dispense** in the **European** Context.
It is coherent with the [European eHN Guidelines](https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/key-documents_en) and preparatory EHDS work.

This implementation guide is designed to be a flexible basis for national specifications as well as crossborder services. 

The EHDS regulation defines the priority categories with the following scope restrictions:
- the prescription is for a medicinal product,
- the prescription is issued by a health professional,
- the prescription is issued for a patient,
- the medication is dispensed by a pharmacy (including online pharmacy),
- the medication is dispensed to a natural person.

While the implementation guide is focusing on the scope mandated by EHDS, it remains flexible to accommodate neighbouring use cases (hospital medication, dispensation by a device, etc) that may benefit from using the same guide as their base.
