# Repository Validation and Deployment Setup

This document explains how to configure the automatic validation and deployment workflow that:
1. Validates R4 and R5 IGs using the FHIR IG Publisher
2. Only deploys to child repositories if validation passes successfully
3. Syncs the content of `igs/mpd-r4` and `igs/mpd-r5` folders to separate repositories

## Required Setup

### 1. GitHub Secrets

You need to create the following secret in your repository settings:

#### `DEPLOY_TOKEN`
- **Type**: Repository Secret
- **Description**: A GitHub Personal Access Token with repository permissions
- **How to create**:
  1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
  2. Generate a new token with the following scopes:
     - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     - `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
  3. Copy the token and add it as a secret named `DEPLOY_TOKEN`

### 2. Repository Variables (Optional)

You can optionally configure the following variables to specify custom repository URLs:

#### `R4_REPO_URL`
- **Type**: Repository Variable
- **Default**: `{repository_owner}/mpd-r4` (dynamically uses the current repository owner)
- **Description**: The target repository for R4 content in format `owner/repo-name`

#### `R5_REPO_URL`
- **Type**: Repository Variable
- **Default**: `{repository_owner}/mpd-r5` (dynamically uses the current repository owner)
- **Description**: The target repository for R5 content in format `owner/repo-name`

### 3. Target Repository Setup

Make sure the target repositories (`{owner}/mpd-r4` and `{owner}/mpd-r5`) exist and the token has write access to them, where `{owner}` is the owner of the current repository (automatically detected).

## How It Works

The workflow (`deploy-to-repos.yml`) triggers on any push to any branch and follows this sequence:

### **Step 1: Validation (Parallel)**
- **validate-r4**: Validates the R4 IG
  - Runs preprocessing (`_preprocessMultiVersion.sh`)
  - Updates IG Publisher
  - Runs full validation (`_genonce.sh`)
- **validate-r5**: Validates the R5 IG
  - Runs preprocessing (`_preprocessMultiVersion.sh`)
  - Updates IG Publisher
  - Runs full validation (`_genonce.sh`)

### **Step 2: Deployment (Only if validation passes)**
If both validations succeed:
- **deploy-r4**: Deploys to R4 repository
  - Runs preprocessing
  - Clones target R4 repository
  - Creates or switches to the same branch name as the source
  - Syncs content from `igs/mpd-r4/` to repository root
  - Commits and pushes changes
  - Creates build trigger for auto-ig-builder
- **deploy-r5**: Deploys to R5 repository
  - Runs preprocessing
  - Clones target R5 repository
  - Creates or switches to the same branch name as the source
  - Syncs content from `igs/mpd-r5/` to repository root
  - Commits and pushes changes
  - Creates build trigger for auto-ig-builder

**If validation fails**: Deployment is skipped and the workflow stops with an error.

## Branch Handling

- The workflow preserves branch names across repositories
- If a branch doesn't exist in the target repository, it creates a new one
- If a branch exists, it updates the existing branch

## Security Notes

- The `DEPLOY_TOKEN` should be kept secure and rotated regularly
- Consider using fine-grained personal access tokens for better security
- The token should have minimal required permissions (repository access only)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: Ensure the `DEPLOY_TOKEN` has write access to target repositories
2. **Repository Not Found**: Check that the repository URLs are correct and accessible
3. **Branch Creation Fails**: Ensure the token has permission to create branches
