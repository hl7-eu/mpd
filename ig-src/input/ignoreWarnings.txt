# ValueSet issues in core spec
Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0%
The definition for the element 'MedicationRequest.priority' binds to the value set 'http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/request-priority|5.0.0' which is experimental, but this structure is not labeled as experimental
The definition for the element 'Medication.ingredient.strength[x]' binds to the value set 'http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/medication-ingredientstrength' which is experimental, but this structure is not labeled as experimental

The URL should refer directly to the ImplementationGuide resource (e.g. include '/ImplementationGuide/')
The canonical URL http://hl7.eu/fhir/extensions doesn't point to an actual ImplementationGuide resource
The canonical URL https://profiles.ihe.net/PHARM/MPD doesn't point to an actual ImplementationGuide resource
The canonical URL for an Implementation Guide must point directly to the implementation guide resource, not to the Implementation Guide as a whole
