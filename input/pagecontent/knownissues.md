### Terminology bindings R4 vs R5  

All value set bindings declared in this implementation guide are with a binding strength 'example'. Normally, the preference is to not create new example value sets but use valid international value set definitions instead - for example, eHDSI EU crossborder services value sets for European scope, or International Patient Summary value sets for international use cases.  
Occasionally, a value set has been defined for R4 or R5 only, and the bindings in R4 and R5 profiles might therefore be slightly different. However, as they are only examples, this should not be a problem, as the content of example value sets should be relatively similar.  

### Extensions with IHE canonical URLs  

HL7 Europe's MPD R5 uses extensions from IHE MPD implementation guide, and therefore, those extensions have canonical URLs assigned by IHE.  
IHE MPD does not have an R4 version of the MPD IG, so these extensions do not have an R4 version defined by IHE. 
In order to keep consistency between two versions, HL7 Europe defines R4 versions of IHE R5 extensions using IHE R5 URLs for canonical URLs.
