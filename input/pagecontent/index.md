### Scope

Specify a set of rules to be applied to HL7 FHIR to define how to represent **Medication Prescription and Dispense** data in the **European** Context, coherently with the [European eHN Guidelines](https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/key-documents_en).


### Purpose
The goal of this Implementation Guide is to define the European standard for Medication Prescriptions and Dispense reports to facilitate the harmonization among the national initiatives and prepare the ground for the European EHR eXchange Format (EEHRxF).

This project is the result of a cross SDO collaboration with IHE Pharmacy, realized in collaboration with several other European and national organizations and projects.

The aspiration of this guide is that of being used as basis for European National Guides, the European EHRxF and - consequently - by MyHealth@EU for the EU cross-border services.

### Background

Medication Prescription and Dispense FHIR implementation guide is an open collaborative work of several projects and initiatives:
- **IHE**: authoring the global MPD profile
- **HL7 Europe**: providing platform for EHDS-related collaboration (partner of XpanDH project)
- [**XpanDH**](https://xpandh-project.iscte-iul.pt): working on proof of concept on European exchange format (EEHRxF) on FHIR (WP 2)
- [**Xt-EHR**](https://www.xt-ehr.eu): preparing future EHDS implementation acts (WP 6, Task 6.2 "ePrescription and eDispensation")
- [**xShare**](https://xshare-project.eu): implementing EEHRxF in various adoption sites

The working group also includes participants from MyHealth@EU, HL7 Pharmacy, EPIC, UNICOM, plus a variety of interested individuals from over 20 countries.
